Homwork # 3: Password Generator

My Task

For this weeks homework we are focusing on javascript. We are given starter code that we need to modify to create a password generator where we will learn the power of javascript. For this generated password we need to make sure to include upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers and special characters. We need to make sure the button functions and generates a password using those options with a password set to range from 8 to 128 characters.

This is the Acceptance Criteria for Homework # 3
